Overview
========

spacefn-win is a Windows implementation of the [SpaceFN] keyboard layout by spiceBar. It is an
[AutoHotkey] script.

**I'm looking for a maintainer.** I have moved away from Windows to Linux, and therefore do not use
AutoHotkey anymore. If you like spacefn-win and would like to maintain it, please contact me.


Installation
============

There are two different ways to go.

The simplest option is to download the compiled file spacefn-win.exe and run it. No installation
required.

The other option is to install [AutoHotkey] 1.1.13.00+ (if you haven't already), download the whole
project and run the spacefn-win.ahk file using AutoHotkey. Use this option if you're already using
AutoHotkey or want to customize the layout.

Either way, put a shortcut to spacefn-win.{ahk,exe} in the Autostart directory to activate the
layout automatically when you log in to your computer. (It won't work in the login screen.)

Download notes
--------------

The stand-alone exe file as well as a zip of the project can be found under [releases]. If you
download the zip file, you must also download [dual], and put the contents of it in the Lib/dual
directory.

git users might want to run `git clone https://github.com/lydell/spacefn-win.git` (to download the
whole project), followed by `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` (to download dual).


Command-line options
====================

The script accepts any number of command line options of the form `option=value`. The following
options are available:

- `swap_backtick_escape`: `true` or `false` (default)
- `mode`: `ijkl` (default), `ijkl2`, `hjkl` or `wasd`
- [`delay`, `timeout` and `doublePress`][dual-config]: Integer (advanced)

Examples:

- `autohotkey spacefn-win.ahk delay=70 swap_backtick_escape=true`
- `spacefn-win.exe delay=70 swap_backtick_escape=true`


Notes
=====

The script assumes that you're using the en-US QWERTY layout. If you're using some other layout, you
unfortunately might have to modify the script. It should be pretty straight-forward, though. Don't
hesitate to ask for help with this, if needed. If you find a way to make the script layout-agnostic,
please tell me!

The [SpaceFN] post mentions a gaming mode. As far as know, using AHK and games at the same time is
not such a good idea.
